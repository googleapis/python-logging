Direct Library Usage
====================

Although the recommended way of using the :mod:`google-cloud-logging` library
is to integrate it with the :doc:`Python logging standard library</std-lib-integration>`,
you can also use the library to interact with the Googel Cloud Logging API 
directly. In additoion to writing logs, using the library in this way allows you to read and delete 
:doc:`logs</entries>`, :doc:`sinks</sink>`, :doc:`metrics</metric>`, and other resources.
