Stackdriver Logging Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Stackdriver Logging. `Stackdriver Logging`_ allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on log data and events from Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

Authentication is typically done through `Application Default Credentials`_,
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

#. When running locally, use the `Google Cloud SDK`_

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud beta auth application-default login


#. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with `additional scopes`_.

#. You can create a `Service Account key file`_. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

.. _Application Default Credentials: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow
.. _additional scopes: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#using
.. _Service Account key file: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them.

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

Samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quickstart
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python quickstart.py


Snippets
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python snippets.py

    usage: snippets.py [-h] logger_name {list,write,delete} ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations on logs and
    log entries with Stackdriver Logging.
    
    For more information, see the README.md under /logging and the
    documentation at https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs.
    
    positional arguments:
      logger_name          Logger name
      {list,write,delete}
        list               Lists the most recent entries for a given logger.
        write              Writes log entries to the given logger.
        delete             Deletes a logger and all its entries. Note that a
                           deletion can take several minutes to take effect.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit


Export
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python export.py

    usage: export.py [-h] {list,create,update,delete} ...
    
    positional arguments:
      {list,create,update,delete}
        list                Lists all sinks.
        create              Lists all sinks.
        update              Changes a sink's filter. The filter determines which
                            logs this sink matches and will be exported to the
                            destination. For example a filter of 'severity>=INFO'
                            will send all logs that have a severity of INFO or
                            greater to the destination. See https://cloud.google.c
                            om/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters for more filter
                            information.
        delete              Deletes a sink.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
