    the preceding call to this method. ``pageToken`` must be the value of

    Attributes:
      LAUNCH_STAGE_UNSPECIFIED (int): Do not use this default value.
      EARLY_ACCESS (int): Early Access features are limited to a closed group of testers. To use
      these features, you must sign up in advance and sign a Trusted Tester
      agreement (which includes confidentiality provisions). These features may
      be unstable, changed in backward-incompatible ways, and are not
      guaranteed to be released.
      ALPHA (int): Alpha is a limited availability test for releases before they are cleared
      for widespread use. By Alpha, all significant design issues are resolved
      and we are in the process of verifying functionality. Alpha customers
      need to apply for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their
      projects whitelisted. Alpha releases donâ€™t have to be feature complete,
      no SLAs are provided, and there are no technical support obligations, but
      they will be far enough along that customers can actually use them in
      test environments or for limited-use tests -- just like they would in
      normal production cases.
      BETA (int): Beta is the point at which we are ready to open a release for any
      customer to use. There are no SLA or technical support obligations in a
      Beta release. Products will be complete from a feature perspective, but
      may have some open outstanding issues. Beta releases are suitable for
      limited production use cases.
      GA (int): GA features are open to all developers and are considered stable and
      fully qualified for production use.
      DEPRECATED (int): JSON name of this field. The value is set by protocol compiler. If
      the user has set a "json_name" option on this field, that option's value

    the following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters,
    forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.

    For backward compatibility, if ``log_name`` begins with a forward-slash,

          DOUBLE (int): The value is a double precision floating point number.
          STRING (int): A definition of a client library method signature.

          In client libraries, each proto RPC corresponds to one or more methods
          which the end user is able to call, and calls the underlying RPC.
          Normally, this method receives a single argument (a struct or instance
          corresponding to the RPC request object). Defining this field will add
          one or more overloads providing flattened or simpler method signatures
          in some languages.

          The fields on the method signature are provided as a comma-separated
          string.

          For example, the proto RPC and annotation:

          rpc CreateSubscription(CreateSubscriptionRequest) returns (Subscription)
          { option (google.api.method_signature) = "name,topic"; }

          Would add the following Java overload (in addition to the method
          accepting the request object):

          public final Subscription createSubscription(String name, String topic)

          The following backwards-compatibility guidelines apply:

          -  Adding this annotation to an unannotated method is backwards
             compatible.
          -  Adding this annotation to a method which already has existing method
             signature annotations is backwards compatible if and only if the new
             method signature annotation is last in the sequence.
          -  Modifying or removing an existing method signature annotation is a
             breaking change.
          -  Re-ordering existing method signature annotations is a breaking
             change.
          DISTRIBUTION (int): ``Any`` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
          along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          ::

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          ::

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

          Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          ::

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

          Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

          ::

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the
          type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z".

          # JSON

          The JSON representation of an ``Any`` value uses the regular
          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional
          field ``@type`` which contains the type URL. Example:

          ::

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
          ``value`` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the ``@type``
          field. Example (for message ``google.protobuf.Duration``):

          ::

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }
          MONEY (int): The value is money.
