                ``[LOG_ID]`` must be URL-encoded. For example:

                ::

                    "projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog"
                    "organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"

                The permission ``logging.logEntries.create`` is needed
                on each project, organization, billing account, or
                folder that is receiving new log entries, whether the
                resource is specified in ``logName`` or in an individual
                log entry.

                This corresponds to the ``log_name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            resource (google.api.monitored_resource_pb2.MonitoredResource):
                Optional. A default monitored resource object that is
                assigned to all log entries in ``entries`` that do not
                specify a value for ``resource``. Example:

                ::

                    { "type": "gce_instance",
                      "labels": {
                        "zone": "us-central1-a", "instance_id": "00000000000000000000" }}

                See [LogEntry][google.logging.v2.LogEntry].

                This corresponds to the ``resource`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            labels (Sequence[google.cloud.logging_v2.types.WriteLogEntriesRequest.LabelsEntry]):
                Optional. Default labels that are added to the
                ``labels`` field of all log entries in ``entries``. If a
                log entry already has a label with the same key as a
                label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is
                not changed. See [LogEntry][google.logging.v2.LogEntry].

                This corresponds to the ``labels`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            entries (Sequence[google.cloud.logging_v2.types.LogEntry]):
                Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order
                of log entries in this list does not matter. Values
                supplied in this method's ``log_name``, ``resource``,
                and ``labels`` fields are copied into those log entries
                in this list that do not include values for their
                corresponding fields. For more information, see the
                [LogEntry][google.logging.v2.LogEntry] type.

                If the ``timestamp`` or ``insert_id`` fields are missing
                in log entries, then this method supplies the current
                time or a unique identifier, respectively. The supplied
                values are chosen so that, among the log entries that
                did not supply their own values, the entries earlier in
                the list will sort before the entries later in the list.
                See the ``entries.list`` method.

                Log entries with timestamps that are more than the `logs
                retention
                period <https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy>`__
                in the past or more than 24 hours in the future will not
                be available when calling ``entries.list``. However,
                those log entries can still be `exported with
                LogSinks <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs>`__.

                To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the `quota
                limit <https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy>`__
                for calls to ``entries.write``, you should try to
                include several log entries in this list, rather than
                calling this method for each individual log entry.

                This corresponds to the ``entries`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,

                should not be set.
            filter (str):
                Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to
                return. See `Advanced Logs
                Queries <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries>`__.
                Only log entries that match the filter are returned. An
                empty filter matches all log entries in the resources
                listed in ``resource_names``. Referencing a parent
                resource that is not listed in ``resource_names`` will
                cause the filter to return no results. The maximum

                the only permitted values are ``"timestamp asc"``
                (default) and ``"timestamp desc"``. The first option
                returns entries in order of increasing values of
                ``LogEntry.timestamp`` (oldest first), and the second
                option returns entries in order of decreasing timestamps
                (newest first). Entries with equal timestamps are
                returned in order of their ``insert_id`` values.

                This corresponds to the ``order_by`` field
