class LogEntry(proto.Message):
    r"""An individual entry in a log.

    Attributes:
        log_name (str):
            Required. The resource name of the log to which this log
            entry belongs:

            ::

                "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
                "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
                "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
                "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"

            A project number may be used in place of PROJECT_ID. The
            project number is translated to its corresponding PROJECT_ID
            internally and the ``log_name`` field will contain
            PROJECT_ID in queries and exports.

            ``[LOG_ID]`` must be URL-encoded within ``log_name``.
            Example:
            ``"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"``.
            ``[LOG_ID]`` must be less than 512 characters long and can
            only include the following characters: upper and lower case
            alphanumeric characters, forward-slash, underscore, hyphen,
            and period.

            For backward compatibility, if ``log_name`` begins with a
            forward-slash, such as ``/projects/...``, then the log entry
            is ingested as usual but the forward-slash is removed.
            Listing the log entry will not show the leading slash and
            filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never
            return any results.
        resource (google.api.monitored_resource_pb2.MonitoredResource):
            Required. The monitored resource that
            produced this log entry.
            Example: a log entry that reports a database
            error would be associated with the monitored
            resource designating the particular database
            that reported the error.
        proto_payload (google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any):
            The log entry payload, represented as a
            protocol buffer. Some Google Cloud Platform
            services use this field for their log entry
            payloads.
            The following protocol buffer types are
            supported; user-defined types are not supported:

            "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"
            "type.googleapis.com/google.appengine.logging.v1.RequestLog".
        text_payload (str):
            The log entry payload, represented as a
            Unicode string (UTF-8).
        json_payload (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Struct):
            The log entry payload, represented as a
            structure that is expressed as a JSON object.
        timestamp (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. The time the event described by the log entry
            occurred. This time is used to compute the log entry's age
            and to enforce the logs retention period. If this field is
            omitted in a new log entry, then Logging assigns it the
            current time. Timestamps have nanosecond accuracy, but
            trailing zeros in the fractional seconds might be omitted
            when the timestamp is displayed.

            Incoming log entries must have timestamps that don't exceed
            the `logs retention
            period <https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas#logs_retention_periods>`__
            in the past, and that don't exceed 24 hours in the future.
            Log entries outside those time boundaries aren't ingested by
            Logging.
        receive_timestamp (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the log entry was
            received by Logging.
        severity (google.logging.type.log_severity_pb2.LogSeverity):
            Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value
            is ``LogSeverity.DEFAULT``.
        insert_id (str):
            Optional. A unique identifier for the log entry. If you
            provide a value, then Logging considers other log entries in
            the same project, with the same ``timestamp``, and with the
            same ``insert_id`` to be duplicates which are removed in a
            single query result. However, there are no guarantees of
            de-duplication in the export of logs.

            If the ``insert_id`` is omitted when writing a log entry,
            the Logging API assigns its own unique identifier in this
            field.

            In queries, the ``insert_id`` is also used to order log
            entries that have the same ``log_name`` and ``timestamp``
            values.
        http_request (google.logging.type.http_request_pb2.HttpRequest):
            Optional. Information about the HTTP request
            associated with this log entry, if applicable.
        labels (Sequence[google.cloud.logging_v2.types.LogEntry.LabelsEntry]):
            Optional. A set of user-defined (key, value)
            data that provides additional information about
            the log entry.
        operation (google.cloud.logging_v2.types.LogEntryOperation):
            Optional. Information about an operation
            associated with the log entry, if applicable.
        trace (str):
            Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log
            entry, if any. If it contains a relative resource name, the
            name is assumed to be relative to
            ``//tracing.googleapis.com``. Example:
            ``projects/my-projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824``
        span_id (str):
            Optional. The span ID within the trace associated with the
            log entry.

            For Trace spans, this is the same format that the Trace API
            v2 uses: a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte
            array, such as ``000000000000004a``.
        trace_sampled (bool):
            Optional. The sampling decision of the trace associated with
            the log entry.

            True means that the trace resource name in the ``trace``
            field was sampled for storage in a trace backend. False
            means that the trace was not sampled for storage when this
            log entry was written, or the sampling decision was unknown
            at the time. A non-sampled ``trace`` value is still useful
            as a request correlation identifier. The default is False.
        source_location (google.cloud.logging_v2.types.LogEntrySourceLocation):
            Optional. Source code location information
            associated with the log entry, if any.
