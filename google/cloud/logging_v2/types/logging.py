class WriteLogEntriesRequest(proto.Message):

    Attributes:
        log_name (str):
            Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to
            all log entries in ``entries`` that do not specify a value
            for ``log_name``:

            -  ``projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]``
            -  ``organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]``
            -  ``billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]``
            -  ``folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]``

            ``[LOG_ID]`` must be URL-encoded. For example:

            ::

                "projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog"
                "organizations/123/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"

            The permission ``logging.logEntries.create`` is needed on
            each project, organization, billing account, or folder that
            is receiving new log entries, whether the resource is
            specified in ``logName`` or in an individual log entry.
        resource (google.api.monitored_resource_pb2.MonitoredResource):
            Optional. A default monitored resource object that is
            assigned to all log entries in ``entries`` that do not
            specify a value for ``resource``. Example:

            ::

                { "type": "gce_instance",
                  "labels": {
                    "zone": "us-central1-a", "instance_id": "00000000000000000000" }}

            See [LogEntry][google.logging.v2.LogEntry].
        labels (Mapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Default labels that are added to the ``labels``
            field of all log entries in ``entries``. If a log entry
            already has a label with the same key as a label in this
            parameter, then the log entry's label is not changed. See
            [LogEntry][google.logging.v2.LogEntry].
        entries (Sequence[google.cloud.logging_v2.types.LogEntry]):
            Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order of
            log entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in
            this method's ``log_name``, ``resource``, and ``labels``
            fields are copied into those log entries in this list that
            do not include values for their corresponding fields. For
            more information, see the
            [LogEntry][google.logging.v2.LogEntry] type.

            If the ``timestamp`` or ``insert_id`` fields are missing in
            log entries, then this method supplies the current time or a
            unique identifier, respectively. The supplied values are
            chosen so that, among the log entries that did not supply
            their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort
            before the entries later in the list. See the
            ``entries.list`` method.

            Log entries with timestamps that are more than the `logs
            retention
            period <https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas>`__ in the
            past or more than 24 hours in the future will not be
            available when calling ``entries.list``. However, those log
            entries can still be `exported with
            LogSinks <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs>`__.

            To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the `quota
            limit <https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas>`__ for calls
            to ``entries.write``, you should try to include several log
            entries in this list, rather than calling this method for
            each individual log entry.
        partial_success (bool):
            Optional. Whether valid entries should be written even if
            some other entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or
            PERMISSION_DENIED errors. If any entry is not written, then
            the response status is the error associated with one of the
            failed entries and the response includes error details keyed
            by the entries' zero-based index in the ``entries.write``
            method.
        dry_run (bool):
            Optional. If true, the request should expect
            normal response, but the entries won't be
            persisted nor exported. Useful for checking
            whether the logging API endpoints are working
            properly before sending valuable data.

            only permitted values are ``"timestamp asc"`` (default) and
            ``"timestamp desc"``. The first option returns entries in
            order of increasing values of ``LogEntry.timestamp`` (oldest
